1. This repository provides essential codes and scripts to ensure reproducibility of the study: "Numerical Simulations of the Multi-scale Processes Causing Heavy Precipitation during Hurricane Hilary's (2023) Passage Over Complex Terrain in the Southwestern U.S."
2. The simulations produced in the aformentioned study were run using WPS 4.5 and WRF-ARW 4.5 versions on the NCAR CISL Derecho Supercomputer (https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/capabilities/derecho).
3. The various libraries/modules used to compile WRF-ARW and WPS are in the environment.txt file.
4. The namelists are attached for both WPS and WRF-ARW in the Namelists folder.
5. Post-Processing scripts to produce the results are found in the Scripts folder.

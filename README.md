1. This repository provides essential codes and scripts to ensure reproducibility of the study: "Numerical Simulations of the Multi-scale Processes Causing Heavy Precipitation during Hurricane Hilary's (2023) Passage Over Complex Terrain in the Southwestern U.S."
2. The simulations for this study were run using WPS v4.5 and WRF-ARW v4.5 on NCARâ€™s CISL Derecho supercomputer (https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/capabilities/derecho).
3. The namelists for both WPS and WRF-ARW are in the Namelists branch.
4. The various libraries/modules used to compile WRF-ARW and WPS are in the environment.txt file in the Namelists branch.
5. Post-Processing scripts to produce the simulated results are in the Scripts branch.
